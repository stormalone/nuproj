## parseval

This is the most simple infrastructure needed with one
nushell command called **echo**

This is a bare bones code set to get nushell up and running.

```
let (classified_block, err) = nu_parser::parse(&line, 0, &ctx.scope);
let result = run_block(&classified_block, ctx, input_stream).await;
```
